#
# This is the main IBM HTTP server configuration file.  It contains the
# configuration directives that give the server its instructions.
# See <URL:http://publib.boulder.ibm.com/httpserv/manual24/> for detailed
# information about the Apache directives.
#
# The instructions provided in this configuration file are only hints or
# reminders.  Consult the online docs for definitive information.
#
# You are strongly encourated to start with the default configuration
# and append your changes to the problem wherever possible, rather than
# changeing it in-line.
#
# The configuration directives are grouped into three basic sections:
#  1. Directives that control the operation of the web server process as a
#     whole (the 'global environment').
#  2. Directives that define the parameters of the 'main' or 'default' server,
#     which responds to requests that aren't handled by a virtual host.
#     These directives also provide default values for the settings
#     of all virtual hosts.
#  3. Settings for virtual hosts, which allow Web requests to be sent to
#     different IP addresses or hostnames and have them handled by the
#     same web server process.
#
# Configuration and logfile names: If the filenames you specify for many
# of the server's control files begin with "/" (or "drive:/" for Win32), the
# server will use that explicit path.  If the filenames do *not* begin
# with "/", the value of ServerRoot is prepended -- so "logs/foo.log"
# with ServerRoot set to "/opt/IBM/IHSXXX/HTTPServer" will be interpreted by the
# server as "/opt/IBM/IHSXXX/HTTPServer/logs/foo.log".
#

### Section 1: Global Environment
#
# The directives in this section affect the overall operation of IBM HTTP
# Server, such as the number of concurrent requests it can handle or where
# it can find its configuration files.
#

#
# ServerRoot: The top of the directory tree under which the server's
# configuration, error, and log files are kept.
#
# Do NOT add a slash at the end of the directory path.
#
ServerRoot "/opt/IBM/IHSUAT/HTTPServer"

#
# The accept serialization lock file MUST BE STORED ON A LOCAL DISK.
#
#LockFile logs/accept.lock

#
# PidFile: The file in which the server should record its process
# identification number when it starts.
#
PidFile logs/httpd.pid

#
# Timeout: The number of seconds before receives and sends time out.
#
Timeout 60

<ifModule mod_reqtimeout.c>

#
# KeepAlive: Whether or not to allow persistent connections (more than
# one request per connection). Set to "Off" to deactivate.
#
KeepAlive On

#
# MaxKeepAliveRequests: The maximum number of requests to allow
# during a persistent connection. Set to 0 to allow an unlimited amount.
# We recommend you leave this number high, for maximum performance.
#
MaxKeepAliveRequests 100

#
# KeepAliveTimeout: Number of seconds to wait for the next request from the
# same client on the same connection.
#
# SUN LIFE CUSTOMIZATION: set set 301 seconds per recommendation by Akamai

# Dynamic Shared Object (DSO) Support

# Statically compiled modules (those listed by `httpd -l') do not need
# to be loaded here.

### Section 2: 'Main' server configuration
#
# The directives in this section set up the values used by the 'main'
# server, which responds to any requests that aren't handled by a
# <VirtualHost> definition.  These values also provide defaults for
# any <VirtualHost> containers you may define later in the file.
#
# All of these directives may appear inside <VirtualHost> containers,
# in which case these default settings will be overridden for the
# virtual host being defined.
#

#
# If you wish httpd to run as a different user or group, you must run
# httpd as root initially and it will switch.
#
User fhkmfpuatadm

#
# ServerAdmin: Your address, where problems with the server should be
# e-mailed.  This address appears on some server-generated pages, such
# as error documents.  e.g. admin@your-domain.com
#
ServerAdmin you@your.address

#
# ServerName gives the name and port that the server uses to identify itself.
# This can often be determined automatically, but we recommend you specify
# it explicitly to prevent problems during startup.
#
# If this is not set to valid DNS name for your host, server-generated
# redirections will not work.  See also the UseCanonicalName directive.
#
# If your host doesn't have a registered DNS name, enter its IP address here.
# You will have to access it by its address anyway, and this will make
# redirections work in a sensible way.
#
ServerName sv81153.hk.sunlife:80

#
# UseCanonicalName: Determines how the web server constructs self-
# referencing URLs and the SERVER_NAME and SERVER_PORT variables.
# When set "Off", the web server will use the Hostname and Port supplied
# by the client.  When set "On", it will use the value of the ServerName
# directive.

# This directive provides a means to enable or disable ServerHeader values.

# This directive configures what you return as the Server HTTP response
